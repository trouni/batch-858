Q2 - What are the different 'table relationships?'



Q3 - Consider this e-library service. An author, defined by his name have several books. A book, defined by its title and publishing year, has one author only. What's this simple database scheme. Please draw it!

- see db.lewagon.org example

Q4 - A user, defined by his email, can read several books. A book (e-book!!) can be read by several user. We also want to keep track of reading dates. Improve your e-library DB scheme with relevant tables and relationships.

- see db.lewagon.org example

Q7 - What's the simple query to get the 3 most recent books written by Jules Verne?

Q12 - Define an ActiveRecord model for each table of your DB. Add the ActiveRecord associations between models.

-- see models

Q14 - Add validations of your choice to the Author class. Can we save an object in DB if its validations do not pass?

-- see author.rb


Database roadmap:

1.) Draw schema (on db.lewagon.org for instance)
2.) Code migrations
3.) Code models
  -> Associations
  -> Validations
